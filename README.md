1. (Relative stability) Anchored or Pegged -> $1.00
   1. Chainlink Price feed.
   2. Set a function  to exchange ETH & BTC -> $$$
2. Stability Mechanism (Minting): Algorithmic (Decentralized)
   1. People can only mint the stablecoin with enough collateral (coded)
3. Collateral: Exogenous (Crypto)
   1. wETH
   2. wBTC

1. What are our invariant/properties? INVARIANTS- Properties of a system that should always hold
* To write an inaviriant test in foundry, we need to import the StdInvariant contract and inherit it, and tell foundry which function to call..
Basically:
Fuzz Tests = Random Data to one function (Stateless fuzzing)
Invariant Tests = Random Data and Random function calls to many functions (stateful fuzzing)


1. Some proper oracle use '
2. Write more tests
3. Smart Contract Audit Preparation <-


Finishing touches not done (it's obvious, I know)
